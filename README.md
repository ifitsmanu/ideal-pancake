# Clean Code Z

Let me give you a short summary of who I am. 


My name is Chris and I'm a 4th year math and stats student that likes to do a bunch of random and dumb things with code.

Whenever I have a ground breaking project idea my code for the most part never works properly! Cause you know sometimes your code just hates you and wants to give you an error for absolutely no reason. 


Other times I just slap a bunch of for loops and truth statements together and what do you know I just cured cancer.


When these rare times do occur though that is when I create an article or video to show off what I created so I can convince myself that this wasn't a complete waste of time.

Now there are a small group of you who read and watch my videos who want to see the code themselves. The only problem with that is that my code is messier than a hoarders garage and at times I can't even understand it. 

Hence the reason you're reading this right now.

You see for those who do read and watch my videos I'm really grateful and I do want to give back in the form of exclusive content.

Clean Code Z is a group that I have offically created, and by being a member you get access to the code that I use in my articles and videos completely free. Now I'm not very creative so with the words Clean-Code in the title you probably know where I'm going with this...

All the pieces of code that your able to access will be fully cleaned and commented so it can be easily read and recreated.

I also just want to say... Please do not hold me to a high standard I'm not this god like coder and I'll be honest you can probably do better me.

So I hope you guys enjoy being apart of this group, and I'll be sending messages out whenever a new piece of mine comes out.

Thanks for reading or watching or whatever you did to get here, I really appreciate it!
